Current work focus is on initializing Docusaurus (apps/docs) and setting up the
CI deployment for docs (docs.yml).

Recent changes include setting up the Docusaurus site using the nx plugin
(nx-extend/docusaurus) in the apps/docs directory.

Next steps include fixing the build error preventing the CI from deploying the
docs to GitHub Pages.

Active decisions include using the nx plugin (nx-extend/docusaurus) for
Docusaurus setup.

Important patterns include following the instructions in the
.clinerules/memory-bank.md file for updating the memory bank.

Learnings include the importance of keeping the memory bank up to date with
accurate and detailed information.
