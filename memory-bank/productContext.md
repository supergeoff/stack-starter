# Product Context

_Why this project exists, problems it solves, how it should work, user
experience goals._

The Technical Accelerator project exists to solve the problem of slow project
setup and inconsistent technical practices across development teams. It aims to
provide a standardized, pre-configured template that enables teams to quickly
start new projects with best practices already integrated. This should improve
developer productivity, reduce onboarding time, and ensure consistency across
projects.

The user experience goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive development
experience, with clear documentation and easy-to-use tools.
