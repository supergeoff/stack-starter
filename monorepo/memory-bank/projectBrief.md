# Project Brief

## Overview

Building a **Technical Accelerator** consisting of a **reusable project template** and a **functional demonstrator application**. The main purpose is to **significantly reduce the time and effort** required to start new projects, ensure adherence to **best practices** (Developer Experience, Security, Observability, Automation), and promote **technical consistency** across teams within the organization. The demonstrator app (an AI Proxy API + Chat Interface) serves as tangible proof of the template's capabilities.

## Core Features

- **Reusable Monorepo Template:** An Nx-based Git repository pre-configured with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi for GCP), comprehensive documentation structure (Docusaurus), and essential tooling (linters, formatters, testing frameworks).
- **Functional Demonstrator Application:** A working web application deployed on GCP featuring an AI Proxy API and a basic Chat interface, built using the template to showcase its practical application[cite: 33, 104, 119, 390].
- **Integrated Best Practices:** The template and demonstrator embed core principles from the start, including "Template-First" design, radical automation, optimized Developer Experience (DX), "Shift-Left" security, native observability, and living documentation.

## Target Users

This accelerator targets **internal development teams** within the company, specifically:

- **Developers:** To enable rapid project setup, provide a productive development environment, and simplify adherence to standards.
- **Tech Leads:** To ensure consistency, quality, security, and maintainability across projects they oversee.
- **Engineering Managers/CTO:** To improve overall engineering velocity, reduce onboarding time, and standardize technical foundations.
